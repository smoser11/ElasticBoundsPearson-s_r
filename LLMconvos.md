\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
% Placeholder abstract
This paper investigates the mathematical boundaries and interpretive limitations of Pearson's correlation coefficient (\( r \)) when applied to ordered-categorical data. We derive analytical and algorithmic procedures to determine the minimum and maximum values of \( r \), connect these to the theory of coupling and Fréchet-Boole bounds, and explore implications for multivariate methods. Our results highlight significant consequences for common practices in survey research, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.

**ChatGPT:**

Awesome! You're already sitting on a very elegant and rigorous theoretical structure 🧠🔥—and yes, I can absolutely improve the organization and integrate your theoretical outline into the earlier LaTeX document seamlessly. Here's what I'll do:

* * *

### ✅ Improvements to Structure:

* **Merge duplicate themes** like symmetry/asymmetry, entropy, and shape effects under a coherent theoretical arc.

* **Clarify logical flow**: from definitions → to bounds → to propositions/proofs → to simulation → to implications.

* Add an **"Extensions & Open Questions"** section for things like entropy and symmetry-breaking, which you may want to flag but not fully resolve in this paper.

* Maintain clean separation between _theoretical results_, _computational tools_, and _empirical illustrations_ for clarity and modularity.

Would you like help **fleshing out the propositions and proofs** next? Or generating a **skeleton .bib file** with some key theoretical sources on coupling, Fréchet inequalities, and correlation bounds?

**Suggested follow-ups:**

* `Write propositions and proofs`

* `Draft background on Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds`

* `Build references.bib file`

* * *

**You:**

I think we can drop the Computational Framework.  But we should disucss very breifly that we have developed an accompanying R: package to explore these issues, and perform hypothesis testing using randomization distributions derived from user-provided marginals.
In terms of theory, what do you think about putttit is all in one section:
1. optimal coupling
1a. Correllary: values for min and max values, analytically derived
2. Frechet-Hoeffd bounds and Boole-Frechet inequalities
2a. Symmetry (why and when $r_{max} \ne -r_{max}$)
2b. the role of ties in obtaining (or not) the Frechet lower bound

What do you think?  Also, should the connection to copula be included?  Or just discussed and left for future work?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great instincts, Scott — your streamlining makes a lot of sense. Let’s break this down step by step and clarify how best to integrate your refined vision. 🧠🧩

* * *

✅ Dropping the "Computational Framework" Section
------------------------------------------------

I agree: the heavy computational detail can be reserved for an appendix or online materials. In the main paper, a **brief paragraph** in either the **Introduction** or **Conclusion** (or both) can highlight the **R package**:

> _We have developed an accompanying R package that computes the minimum and maximum possible Pearson correlation given arbitrary marginal distributions, and supports hypothesis testing using randomization distributions derived from user-supplied marginals. Details, examples, and code are available in the online appendix._

* * *

✅ Unifying the Theory Section
-----------------------------

You're absolutely right to consolidate the theoretical content under one coherent umbrella, especially since the components (optimal couplings, bounds, symmetry, ties) are interdependent.

Here’s a proposed **structure for the theoretical section** (with numbering that maps to your list):

* * *

### 🧮 Proposed Section: **Theoretical Framework**

```latex
\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Optimal Coupling and Correlation Bounds}
We formalize the problem of identifying the joint distribution (coupling) of two ordinal variables with fixed marginals that maximizes or minimizes the Pearson correlation. Using properties of monotonic rearrangements and the theory of isotone couplings, we derive the analytical expressions for \( r_{\max} \) and \( r_{\min} \).

\subsubsection*{Corollary: Analytic Forms for \( r_{\min} \) and \( r_{\max} \)}
We provide closed-form expressions or bounds for the extreme correlations, and discuss cases in which these are attained or unattainable.

\subsection{Fréchet–Hoeffding Bounds and Boole–Fréchet Inequalities}
This section relates the correlation bounds to the well-known Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds on joint distribution functions. The Boole–Fréchet inequalities offer pointwise constraints that restrict feasible joint configurations, and thus constrain the attainable values of Pearson's \( r \).

\subsubsection*{Symmetry Considerations: When is \( r_{\min} \neq -r_{\max} \)?}
We explore when the bounds are symmetric around zero, and under what conditions symmetry breaks — e.g., differences in marginal shape, support size, or central tendency.

\subsubsection*{The Role of Ties}
We demonstrate how ties in marginal distributions prevent the attainment of Fréchet lower bounds, and explain the implications for achieving \( r_{\min} \).

% (Optional)
\subsection{Relation to Copula Theory (Discussion)}
Although our analysis is grounded in discrete data, we briefly discuss the relevance of copula theory — especially empirical copulas and discrete analogues — as a conceptual framework for modeling dependence with fixed marginals. This connection opens several avenues for future research.
```

* * *

✅ To Include Copulas or Not?
----------------------------

Here’s the trade-off:

### 🧩 **Reasons to include a brief copula discussion (but not go deep):**

* Copulas are **increasingly recognized** as the correct formalism for modeling dependence structures independently of marginals.

* Even in the discrete setting, **copula-like constructions** (e.g., checkerboard copulas) can help position your work within a broader statistical theory.

* It's good intellectual scaffolding for **future extensions** — especially if your R package evolves toward supporting rank-based copula approaches or more general stochastic ordering tools.


### 📌 **Suggested approach:**

Include **a brief subsection (or paragraph)** under the theoretical section — or even in the **"Extensions and Open Questions"** section — noting the connection to copulas:

> _Although our current results focus on discrete joint distributions, the problem of finding extremal correlations under fixed marginals is closely related to the copula approach in continuous settings. While copula theory offers powerful tools for separating marginal effects from dependence structures, its application in discrete contexts remains nontrivial. Exploring the discrete copula analogues of our bounds is an important direction for future research._

* * *

🔁 Revised TOC Fragment (with your revisions)
---------------------------------------------

Here's how this revised structure would look in the outline:

```latex
\section{Theoretical Framework}
  \subsection{Optimal Coupling and Correlation Bounds}
    \subsubsection*{Corollary: Analytic Forms for \( r_{\min} \) and \( r_{\max} \)}
  \subsection{Fréchet–Hoeffding Bounds and Boole–Fréchet Inequalities}
    \subsubsection*{Symmetry Considerations: When is \( r_{\min} \neq -r_{\max} \)?}
    \subsubsection*{The Role of Ties}
  \subsection{Relation to Copula Theory (Discussion)}
```

And we remove the earlier "Computational Framework" section entirely.

* * *

### ✅ Ready to move forward?

I can help write the **"Optimal Coupling and Correlation Bounds"** subsection next — including your propositions and derivations — or get started on a **precise formulation of symmetry-breaking conditions**.

**Suggested follow-ups:**

* `Write Optimal Coupling subsection`

* `Draft symmetry and tie-related theory`

* `Copula discussion paragraph`

* * *

**You:**

Sorry, now I'm confused.  show me a high-level outline of the paper, please.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No worries at all, Scott — let's zoom back out and get a clear **high-level outline** of the paper. Here's a clean, structured version that reflects:

* Your theoretical focus

* Your decision to **drop the computational framework** as a standalone section

* A **unified theory section**

* A **light touch on copulas** as a future direction

* Emphasis on **empirical relevance** and **practical implications**

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks, Scott! You've got all the right ingredients — they just need tidying into a clean, **non-redundant**, logically ordered structure. I’ve done that below with care to:

* Remove repeated sections (e.g., "Empirical Illustration" appeared twice).

* Consolidate similar subsections (e.g., symmetry breaking and ties).

* Clarify hierarchical section structure.

* Ensure that optional or future-facing elements (like copulas) are placed appropriately.

* Place practical tools (R package) in **Conclusion**, with pointer to **Appendix B**.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Pearson’s correlation coefficient \( r \), when applied to ordinal data, is subject to elasticity due to constraints from marginal distributions. This paper develops theoretical bounds for \( r \), based on Boole–Fréchet–Hoeffding inequalities and rearrangement inequalities, and derives analytic expressions for their limits. We investigate when symmetry in the bounds holds or breaks, and explore practical implications for correlation-based methods like PCA and SEM. An accompanying R package allows users to compute bounds and perform hypothesis tests given fixed marginals.

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The widespread use of Pearson’s \( r \) with ordinal data.
  \item The problem of elasticity: how max/min bounds of \( r \) vary with marginals.
  \item Contributions: (1) theory of optimal bounds, (2) symmetry-breaking conditions, (3) empirical consequences, (4) supporting tools.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Background and Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ordinal data and assumptions of interval-scale correlation.
  \item Existing alternatives: Spearman, polychoric, polyserial; their strengths and limitations.
  \item Coupling and rearrangement in discrete settings.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Optimal Coupling and Correlation Bounds}
We formalize the problem of identifying the joint distribution (coupling) of two ordinal variables with fixed marginals that maximizes or minimizes the Pearson correlation.

\subsubsection*{Corollary: Analytic Forms for \( r_{\min} \) and \( r_{\max} \)}
Closed-form expressions and bounds are derived, including cases of unattainability.

\subsection{Fréchet–Hoeffding and Boole–Fréchet Inequalities}
These classical bounds define feasible joint distributions given marginals and constrain the attainable values of \( r \).

\subsection{Symmetry and the Role of Ties}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conditions under which \( r_{\min} = -r_{\max} \).
  \item How ties in marginal distributions affect the attainability of the lower bound.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Cases and Boundary Conditions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Equal vs. unequal numbers of categories.
  \item Symmetric vs. asymmetric marginal distributions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relation to Copula Theory (Optional)}
Although our setting is discrete, the problem is conceptually linked to copula-based modeling of dependence with fixed marginals. The connection is discussed as a direction for future work.

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Empirical Illustration and Practical Relevance}

\subsection{Effects of Marginal Shapes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shape-based elasticity of correlation bounds.
  \item Influence of skewness, modality, and entropy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Symmetry Breaking in Correlation Bounds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item When and why \( r_{\min} \neq -r_{\max} \).
  \item Empirical indicators of bound asymmetry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications and Implications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Impact on PCA, factor analysis, and SEM using ordinal data.
  \item Practical risks: over-factoring, biased structural coefficients.
  \item Recommendations for interpreting Pearson's \( r \) in applied contexts.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Extensions and Open Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Role of entropy and joint uncertainty in bounding behavior.
  \item Probabilistic modeling over the \( r \in [r_{\min}, r_{\max}] \) interval.
  \item Possibility of adjusting or normalizing \( r \).
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summary: Theoretical bounds, symmetry-breaking conditions, and implications for applied research.
  \item An R package accompanies this paper, providing tools to compute max/min bounds and perform randomization-based hypothesis tests for fixed marginals. Details are available in the appendix and online.
  \item Future work: deeper integration with copula models, correction strategies, and generalizations to higher dimensions.

# Conversation 2

"""
**You:**

Here is a memo and some notes from a meeting with Cees, a co-author:
"""
You are an expert psychometrician with speciality in latent trait and latent class models.  You have a background in analysis of survey data, especially public opinion and political attitudes. You and I are going to investigate the consequences of treating ordinal variables as measured on an interval-level scale and how the resulting Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$) behaves when correlating the ranks.

Here is the setting:
We are given the marginal distribution of two ordinal variables, $X$ (with $K_X$ levels, $0,1,2,\ldots, K_X-1$) and $Y$,  (with $K_X$ levels, $0,1,2,\ldots, K_X-1$).   The goals are to:
1.find the min and max Pearson's correlation, $r_{XY}$
2.write an function in R: to simulate the empirical distribution of  $r_{XY}$ under the assumption of 'random data', given the sample.  That is fill in the cells of the contingency table at random, while preserving the marginal distributions.


Using the results from Witt 1968  how we know how to  maximize $E[XY]$, the expected value of the product of two ordinal variables $X$ and $Y$, given their **marginal distributions**.

### **Step 1: Understanding $E[XY]$ in a Contingency Table**

The expectation is computed as:

$$E[XY] = \sum_{i,j} x_i y_j P(X = x_i, Y = y_j)$$

where:

* $x_i, y_j$ are the ordinal values of $X$ and $Y$,
* $P(X = x_i, Y = y_j)$ is the joint probability.

To **maximize** $E[XY]$, we must allocate the joint probabilities in a way that **pairs the highest values of $X$ with the highest values of $Y$, and the lowest values of $X$ with the lowest values of $Y$**.

What do you think?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

This is a strong and well-structured outline that covers both the theoretical and applied aspects of the problem. Here are a few thoughts:

### **Strengths of the Outline**

✅ **Clear Research Question:** The project is well-motivated, addressing a fundamental issue in the use of Pearson’s _r_ with ordinal data. It directly speaks to survey researchers, political scientists, and methodologists.

✅ **Balance Between Theory & Application:** The outline includes both analytical and algorithmic solutions, as well as empirical simulations, which should make the study robust.

✅ **Relevance to Applied Research:** The discussion of how _r_ is used in social science research (e.g., SEM, factor analysis) makes it highly relevant for practitioners.

✅ **Well-Defined Outputs:** Targeting a journal submission, developing R/Stata modules, and providing online appendices will make the project impactful and widely accessible.

### **Areas to Clarify or Expand**

🔹 **Scope of the Study:**

* Will the focus be primarily on equal-category ordinal variables, or will it also cover cases with unequal numbers of categories? The note suggests this is still an open question.

* Should there be a discussion on how these issues extend beyond Pearson’s _r_ to other measures (e.g., polychoric correlations, Spearman’s _ρ_)?


🔹 **Comparison to Alternative Measures:**

* Would it be useful to briefly compare Pearson’s _r_ to other ordinal correlation measures (e.g., polychoric _r_, Spearman's _ρ_, Kendall’s _τ_) in terms of their min/max behavior?

* If _r_ is problematic, should alternative measures be recommended? Or is the goal strictly to map its behavior?


🔹 **Probability Distribution of _r_**

* The question of whether we can derive a probability distribution of _r_ over its min-max range is interesting. Would this be done analytically, via simulation, or both?


🔹 **Practical Implications for Researchers**

* Should the article offer practical recommendations for researchers using Pearson’s _r_ with ordinal data? For example, could there be a decision tree or guidelines based on number of categories, skewness, etc.?


### **Final Thoughts**

This is shaping up to be a valuable methodological contribution. The structure is solid, but a bit more clarity on the scope, possible comparisons to alternatives, and practical takeaways would help refine the focus. Would you like to workshop any of these ideas further?

* * *

**You:**

Very good.  With this in mind, please suggest (1) next steps and (2) an outline for a paper.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Thank you! Based on the project’s current state, here’s what I suggest for **next steps** and a **refined paper outline**.

* * *

**(1) Next Steps**
------------------

### **Immediate Steps (Conceptual & Analytical Foundation)**

✅ **Clarify Scope:**

* Will the study focus **only** on ordinal variables with the same number of categories, or also include cases with different category counts?

* Will the analysis consider only Pearson’s _r_, or briefly compare alternative correlation measures (polychoric _r_, Spearman’s _ρ_)?


✅ **Develop Analytical Solutions:**

* Derive min/max values of _r_ given fixed marginal distributions.

* Consider whether the probability distribution of _r_ over its min-max interval can be determined analytically.


✅ **Build Algorithmic Solutions & Simulations:**

* Write an R function to simulate _r_ under random data allocation while preserving marginals.

* Implement iterative solutions to validate analytical bounds.


### **Mid-Term Steps (Empirical & Practical Implications)**

✅ **Run Empirical Simulations:**

* Generate contingency tables for different numbers of categories (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10).

* Compare _r_ values to their theoretical min/max and explore factors influencing _r_’s position in this range.


✅ **Assess Practical Implications:**

* How does treating ordinal data as interval-level impact statistical models (e.g., SEM, factor analysis)?

* Should researchers adjust _r_ based on its min/max, or use alternative measures?


### **Long-Term Steps (Finalizing Outputs & Submission)**

✅ **Draft Paper & Code Documentation:**

* Organize findings into a structured paper.

* Prepare R (and possibly Stata) scripts for public release.


✅ **Target Journal Selection & Submission:**

* Decide on a target journal based on impact and audience (e.g., _Political Analysis_, _Sociological Methods & Research_).


* * *

**(2) Refined Paper Outline**
-----------------------------

### **Title (Tentative)**

📌 _From Contingency Tables to Correlation: The Min/Max Bounds of Pearson’s r for Ordinal Data_

### **1. Abstract**

* Summary of the problem: Pearson’s _r_ is widely used with ordinal data, but its behavior depends on distributional constraints.

* Key contributions: Derivation of min/max boundaries, simulations to illustrate _r_'s behavior, implications for statistical models.


### **2. Introduction**

* Why correlation matters in survey and social science research.

* The common assumption that ordinal variables can be treated as interval-level.

* The specific problem: _r_ has theoretical min/max values that depend on marginal distributions.

* Goals of the paper:

    1. Derive min/max bounds of _r_.

    2. Explore factors influencing attenuation of _r_.

    3. Discuss implications for common statistical methods.


### **3. The Problem: Correlation with Ordinal Data**

* **Illustrative Example:** A 2×2 contingency table showing how _r_ can take different values.

* **How _r_ is Used in Practice:** Examples from survey research, political science, and SEM.

* **Why This Matters:** Misinterpretation of _r_ can lead to incorrect conclusions in empirical work.


### **4. Deriving the Min/Max Boundaries of _r_**

    * Generate contingency tables for different numbers of categories (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10).

    * Randomly allocate joint probabilities while preserving marginals.

    * Calculate _r_ for each random allocation.

* **Results:**

    * Distribution of _r_ across its min/max range.

    * Factors affecting _r_: Skewness, variance differences, number of categories.

    * Is _r_ systematically closer to its min, max, or center?


### **6. Implications for Statistical Methods**

* Open questions:

    * Can an adjusted correlation measure be developed?

    * How do these issues extend to regression-based models?


### **8. References**

* Key citations (Witt 1968, survey methodology sources, applications of _r_ in SEM).


### **9. Appendices**

* **Technical Proofs:** Derivations of min/max _r_ values.

* **R/Stata Code:** Functions for calculating min/max _r_ and running simulations.


* * *

### **Final Thoughts**

This outline keeps a strong balance between **theoretical rigor** and **practical application**, making it valuable for both statisticians and applied researchers. Does this structure align with your vision for the paper? Would you like to adjust the focus on any section?

* * *

**You:**

Please critique the above response, noting that more specific examples and details are required. Then based on the critique, output the full improved response.  We will Include non-square tables (e.g., 4x5, 3x7), to generalize results and assess robustness across asymmetric measurement scales.  We will  not use a 2×2 table -- it is too small.  Perhaps a 4x5 or something -- _if_ it can be illustrative. We have several R functions already to perform different tasks (do you want to see them?).  We have ranization distributions (under the null of no association) already.  Simulation is all sorted, using permutation randomization.


* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great — thank you for the thoughtful guidance. Here's a **critique** of the previous response, followed by a fully revised and **improved version** of the next steps and paper outline that reflects your updated plan and includes more specific detail.

* * *

🔍 **Critique of Previous Response**
------------------------------------

While the original response offered a solid **framework**, it fell short in the following key areas:

### 1. **Lack of Specific Examples**

* The 2×2 table suggestion was too simplistic, especially given your intent to focus on more informative, mid-sized ordinal tables (e.g., 4×5).

* The description of empirical simulation design was too abstract — no mention of actual examples, variable structures, or how differences in marginal distributions would be implemented.


### 2. **Not Incorporating Available Work**

* You already have simulation tools, randomization distributions, and R functions — the earlier version mistakenly suggested you still need to develop those.

* This leads to misalignment between your current project status and the recommended next steps.


### 3. **Omission of Asymmetric Measurement Scales**

* The plan to include **non-square** contingency tables (e.g., 4×5, 3×7) is crucial and was not emphasized.

* This is important for real-world survey research where Likert scales often differ in resolution.


### 4. **Need for Tighter Integration of Theoretical and Simulation Parts**

* The earlier outline could better integrate how simulations illustrate or test theoretical bounds.

* The relationship between analytical and empirical components needs to be made more explicit.


* * *

✅ **Improved Response: Next Steps and Full Paper Outline**
----------------------------------------------------------

* * *

### **(1) Next Steps**

#### 🔹 A. Finalize Conceptual Boundaries

* **Confirm scope**: We will include both **square** (e.g., 4×4) and **non-square** (e.g., 4×5, 3×7) ordinal variable combinations to assess robustness across **asymmetric measurement scales**.

* **Drop 2×2 tables**: These are too limited to be informative about the behavior of _r_. Focus instead on 4–10 category items (common in survey data).

* **Clarify treatment of null hypothesis**: Simulations are permutation-based under the null of no association. Make this central in framing results.


#### 🔹 B. Organize Existing Tools and Results

* **Document existing R functions**: (Yes, please do share! It would help with streamlining analysis plans.)

    * Which functions calculate min/max _r_?

    * Which generate random contingency tables preserving marginals?

    * Which compute expected _E[XY]_ given marginals?

* **Summarize existing simulation results**: You’ve already generated randomization distributions — these can now be summarized and integrated with theoretical bounds.


#### 🔹 C. Analytical and Visual Components

* **Visual Illustrations**: Select a few illustrative cases (e.g., 4×5 and 5×5 tables) to show the min, max, and distribution of _r_.

* **Heatmaps or contour plots**: Consider visualizing how _r_ varies across the configuration space (e.g., skewness, concentration, etc.) for given marginals.

* **Derive or confirm min/max _r_** using known algorithms (e.g., max _E[XY]_ using linear programming).


#### 🔹 D. Writing & Integration

* Begin drafting sections where theoretical and empirical findings are already aligned (e.g., min/max derivation and its empirical demonstration).

* Flag sections that will benefit from finalized visuals or case examples.


* * *

### **(2) Revised Paper Outline**

* * *

#### **Title (Tentative)**

📌 _From Contingency Tables to Correlation: Bounding Pearson’s _r_ for Ordinal Data with Fixed Marginals_

* * *

#### **1. Abstract**

* Pearson’s _r_ is routinely applied to ordinal data, often without regard for the implications of the measurement scale.

* We investigate the theoretical minimum and maximum values of _r_, given fixed marginal distributions.

* Using permutation-based randomization and exhaustive simulations, we show how _r_ behaves under null conditions and how its boundaries depend on distributional features.

* Implications for structural modeling and measurement error are discussed.


* * *

#### **2. Introduction**

* Ordinal data (e.g., Likert-type items) are pervasive in public opinion and survey research.

* Despite being inherently ordered categorical variables, these are often treated as interval-level in applied work.

* Pearson’s _r_ is commonly used, yet its behavior under ordinal scaling is constrained by the marginal distributions.

* This paper investigates:

    1. The attainable range (min/max) of _r_ given ordinal marginals;

    2. The shape of _r_'s distribution under random association (null of independence);

    3. Implications for modeling practices (e.g., SEM, factor analysis).


* * *

#### **3. The Problem Defined: Correlation under Ordinal Constraints**

* **Why this matters**: Spurious attenuation or inflation of correlation due to misaligned scaling assumptions.

* **Pearson’s _r_ formula**: How it depends on means and variances of X and Y, and on _E[XY]_.

* **Key insight**: For given marginals, _E[XY]_ — and hence _r_ — has a minimum and maximum, bounded by the ways one can assign joint probabilities consistent with those marginals.


* * *

#### **4. Analytical Framework**

* **Bounding _E[XY]_:** Drawing on Witt (1968), we identify the configurations that maximize/minimize _E[XY]_.

* **Monotone matching algorithm**: Pair large values of X with large (or small) values of Y to get max (or min) _E[XY]_.

* **Linear programming formulation**: A general approach to optimizing _E[XY]_ given marginals for both square and non-square tables.

* **Worked example**: A 4×5 contingency table with skewed marginals, showing analytic bounds on _r_.


* * *

#### **5. Simulation Design**

* **Randomization via permutation**: Hold marginals fixed, assign cell counts at random under null of no association.

* **Conditions varied**:

    * Number of categories: 3×3, 4×4, 4×5, 3×7, 5×5, 7×10

    * Symmetric vs asymmetric distributions

    * Skewed vs uniform marginals

    * Unimodal vs bimodal marginals

* **Outputs**:

    * Distribution of _r_ under random permutations

    * Empirical min/max vs theoretical bounds

    * Visuals: histograms, density plots, overlaid bounds


* * *

#### **6. Results**

* **Distributions of _r_**:

    * _r_ is not uniformly distributed between min and max

    * Shape of distribution highly sensitive to marginal skew and variance differences

* **Key findings**:

    * _r²_ is **not** generally at midpoint between min² and max²

    * Distributions of _r_ often skewed toward 0 but can exhibit bias depending on marginals

    * Asymmetric tables (e.g., 4×5) show more constrained ranges

* **Illustrative examples**: Annotated examples using 4×5 and 3×7 tables


* * *

#### **7. Implications for Practice**

* **SEM & factor analysis**: Underestimated correlations can lead to over-factoring or misestimated path coefficients.

* **Best practices**:

    * Report _r_ in context of its theoretical range

    * Consider alternatives like polychoric _r_ when latent continuity is assumed

    * Use simulation-based diagnostics when marginals are highly skewed or asymmetric

* **What we don’t recommend**:

    * Mechanical correction of _r_ (e.g., re-scaling to full [-1, 1] range) without strong assumptions


* * *

#### **8. Conclusions and Recommendations**

* Pearson’s _r_ with ordinal data must be interpreted within its attainable range.

* Fixed marginal distributions impose real, non-obvious constraints on correlation.

* Researchers should assess where observed _r_ falls relative to its feasible range before interpreting effect size or structural paths.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Pearson’s correlation coefficient \( r \), when applied to ordinal data, is subject to elasticity due to constraints from marginal distributions. This paper develops theoretical bounds for \( r \), based on Boole–Fréchet–Hoeffding inequalities and rearrangement inequalities, and derives analytic expressions for their limits. We investigate when symmetry in the bounds holds or breaks, and explore practical implications for correlation-based methods like PCA and SEM. An accompanying R package allows users to compute bounds and perform hypothesis tests given fixed marginals.

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The widespread use of Pearson’s \( r \) with ordinal data.
  \item The problem of elasticity: how max/min bounds of \( r \) vary with marginals.
  \item Contributions: (1) theory of optimal bounds, (2) symmetry-breaking conditions, (3) empirical consequences, (4) supporting tools.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Background and Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ordinal data and assumptions of interval-scale correlation.
  \item Existing alternatives: Spearman, polychoric, polyserial; their strengths and limitations.

\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Optimal Coupling and Correlation Bounds}
We formalize the problem of identifying the joint distribution (coupling) of two ordinal variables with fixed marginals that maximizes or minimizes the Pearson correlation.

\subsubsection*{Corollary: Analytic Forms for \( r_{\min} \) and \( r_{\max} \)}
Closed-form expressions and bounds are derived, including cases of unattainability.

\subsection{Fréchet–Hoeffding and Boole–Fréchet Inequalities}
These classical bounds define feasible joint distributions given marginals and constrain the attainable values of \( r \).

\subsection{Symmetry and the Role of Ties}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conditions under which \( r_{\min} = -r_{\max} \).
  \item How ties in marginal distributions affect the attainability of the lower bound.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Equal vs. unequal numbers of categories.
  \item Symmetric vs. asymmetric marginal distributions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relation to Copula Theory (Optional)}
Although our setting is discrete, the problem is conceptually linked to copula-based modeling of dependence with fixed marginals. The connection is discussed as a direction for future work.

\title{From Contingency Tables to Correlation: Bounding Pearson’s \textit{r} for Ordinal Data with Fixed Marginals}

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pearson’s correlation coefficient \( r \) is widely used in social science research, including with ordinal variables such as Likert-type survey items.
  \item A common but problematic assumption is that ordinal variables can be treated as interval-scaled, allowing use of parametric statistics like Pearson’s \( r \).
  \item We explore how marginal distributions constrain the possible values of \( r \), leading to an \textit{elastic} range bounded by a theoretical minimum and maximum.
  \item Our contributions are fourfold:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
      \item Derive analytic and algorithmic bounds for \( r \) with fixed marginals.
      \item Identify conditions under which bounds are symmetric or asymmetric.
      \item Illustrate the practical consequences for applied statistical modeling.
      \item Provide a software toolkit to support computation and testing.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Background and Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ordinal Variables}: Discrete, ordered categories, often arising from rating scales. Their use in correlation poses challenges due to undefined distance between levels.
  \item \textbf{Common Correlation Alternatives}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spearman’s \( \rho \): rank-based, but ignores marginal distributions.
      \item Polychoric correlation: assumes underlying bivariate normality.
      \item Polyserial correlation: mixes continuous and ordinal assumptions.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Coupling and Rearrangement}: A probabilistic method for generating joint distributions with fixed marginals; foundational for bounding statistics like \( r \).
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Optimal Coupling and Correlation Bounds}
We formalize the problem of identifying the joint distribution (coupling) of two ordinal variables with fixed marginals that maximizes or minimizes the Pearson correlation.

\subsubsection*{Corollary: Analytic Forms for \( r_{\min} \) and \( r_{\max} \)}
Closed-form expressions and bounds are derived from known results on extremal expectations under fixed marginals. In some cases, extrema are not strictly attainable due to discretization effects.

\subsection{Fréchet–Hoeffding and Boole–Fréchet Inequalities}
These classical results define the upper and lower limits of joint cumulative distributions given fixed marginals. When applied to ordinal variables, they constrain the admissible space for \( E[XY] \), and thus \( r \).

\subsection{Symmetry and the Role of Ties}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We explore when \( r_{\min} = -r_{\max} \), typically under symmetric marginals.
  \item Ties in distributions (non-uniformity or repeated values) often lead to asymmetry in the feasible bounds of \( r \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Cases and Boundary Conditions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our framework accommodates both equal (e.g., 4×4) and unequal (e.g., 4×5, 3×7) numbers of categories.
  \item We demonstrate how asymmetric marginals (e.g., skewed, unimodal) affect the feasible range of \( r \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relation to Copula Theory (Optional)}
Though we work in discrete space, the problem of bounding correlation given fixed marginals is conceptually related to copula theory, which models dependence structures independent of marginal forms.

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Empirical Illustration and Practical Relevance}

\subsection{Simulation Design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We generate random contingency tables via permutation-based randomization, preserving marginal distributions.
  \item Scenarios include:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Category structures: 3×3, 4×4, 4×5, 3×7, 5×5, 7×10
      \item Marginal types: uniform, skewed, bimodal
      \item Distributions with varying entropy and variance
    \end{itemize}
  \item For each scenario, we simulate the empirical distribution of \( r \) and compare it to theoretical min/max values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects of Marginal Shapes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Skewness and modality heavily influence the attainable range of \( r \).
  \item Marginals with extreme concentration (e.g., most responses in one or two categories) sharply restrict the possible correlation range.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Symmetry Breaking in Correlation Bounds}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In asymmetric tables, the min and max bounds of \( r \) are not symmetric about zero.
  \item The shape of the null distribution of \( r \) can be strongly skewed, especially in cases with unequal marginals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications and Implications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Impacts standard methods:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{PCA and Factor Analysis}: Attenuated correlations may lead to over-factoring.
      \item \textbf{SEM}: Biased estimation of structural paths if ordinal-level attenuation is ignored.
    \end{itemize}
  \item We recommend:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reporting observed \( r \) in context of its attainable bounds.
      \item Using our tools to test whether an observed \( r \) is unusually strong or weak given marginals.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Extensions and Open Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item How does marginal entropy relate to the flexibility of \( r \)'s bounds?
  \item Is there a principled way to adjust or normalize \( r \) given its feasible interval?
  \item Can these results extend to multivariate correlation structures (e.g., partial \( r \), canonical correlation)?
  \item What is the potential for integrating with discrete copula frameworks?
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pearson’s \( r \), when used with ordinal variables, is bounded in non-obvious ways by the marginal distributions.
  \item We provide theoretical derivations, empirical validation, and software tools to make these constraints visible and usable.
  \item Future work should explore latent modeling connections, correction strategies, and extensions to higher-dimensional data.
